# Guwahati_Bus_Planner

Guwahati Bus Planner
I made this project using the Dijkstra algorithm that I learned in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. It is developed to help plan and optimize routes for my college's city bus services in Guwahati. The project helps users efficiently find the best routes between bus stops.

Features
Find Shortest Path: Allows users to input a starting and ending bus stop to find the shortest route between them.
Route Optimization: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path based on real-time bus stop data.
Interactive Map: A user-friendly interface displaying bus stops, routes, and the shortest paths between stops.
Search Stops: Users can search for bus stops and view available routes from each one.
